Python game
-----------------

A simple game made using Pygame library, the goal of the game is to eliminate all opponents using spells. Game ends when you lose all your health points.

Game was created in group of two during winter break.
We had plans for the further development of the game but due to lack of time during the semester we decided not to continue the game.

Game contains:

Main charakter - Wizard
Wizard is controlled by the player.
Wizard can cast 2 spells - Fireball and Shield.
Fireball can be casted 3 times in a short period of time. After third use Fireball has a longer cooldown.
Shield makes you immortal and units that will attack you will lose health points instead of you.

We managed to make only one type of opponent: Death
Death damages you by walking into you (we didn't make getting damage animation).
Death is weak, it is dying from fireball and it's own attack.

We also created only one stage, and we didn't create ending screen. Only death screen.



After all creating this game was only a way to get better at python. Repository contains game source code and a short video of gameplay.
